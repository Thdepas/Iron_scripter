The Chairman has returned with a new challenge that will test not only your PowerShell skills but your networking knowledge as well. The challenge has been graded for Intermediate and Advanced levels, but donâ€™t let that stop you.

Depending on how you approach the challenge, you may find it easier to break it down into discrete parts.

Using PowerShell, write a function, or set of functions, that will test if an IPv4 address like 172.16.2.33/16 belongs to the 172.16.0.0 network. You should test your code with addresses that go beyond the /16 or /24 network boundaries. Or you might come at this from another angle. What is the subnet mask for an address like 172.16.10.20/17? And what network does that represent?

You will have to decide how to accept parameter values for the IP Address, subnet and/or subnet mask. Advanced users should include Verbose output showing the process. Advanced users should also provide 2 parameter sets. One to display a boolean value if the address belongs to the subnet and another to provide detailed information.

The Chairman looks forward to reading your comments with links to your solutions.
